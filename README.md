 ### About
 The application serves for the income tax calculation of the Minnesota state citizens. The tax calculation is based on a complex algorithm provided by the Minnesota state and the necessary data for it is loaded from txt or xml files. Each file contains information about a citizen, such as marital status, income, and an amount of that they have spent, as witnessed by a set of receipts declared along with the income. The application further produces graphical representations of the data in terms of bar and pie charts. Finally, the application produces respective output reports in txt or xml.
